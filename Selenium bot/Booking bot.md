# 🛎️ Hotel Search Automation Bot – Booking.com

A Selenium automation script that performs hotel searches on [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com) based on user-defined inputs such as location, travel dates, number of guests, and filters.

This bot simulates a real user's interaction with the site, selecting options, submitting the form, and navigating results — a practical use case of browser automation for research, QA testing, or scraping preparation.
