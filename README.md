# ðŸ¤– QA Automation with Python, Selenium, and Playwright

I am actively developing skills in QA Automation using Python with Selenium and Playwright to create efficient and scalable automated testing solutions. This focus enhances my ability to ensure software quality through robust and reliable test automation frameworks.

Key Areas of Study:

    Test Automation Frameworks: Building and maintaining automated testing frameworks with Python.
    Selenium WebDriver: Automating browser interactions for web application testing.
    Playwright: Implementing modern, cross-browser automation for end-to-end testing.
    Test Design: Writing modular, reusable, and data-driven test scripts.
    Continuous Integration: Integrating automated tests into CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.
    Error Handling & Reporting: Implementing logging, reporting, and debugging for test failures.

Current Focus:

    Developing and executing automated UI and functional tests.
    Enhancing test coverage and reliability across different browsers and devices.
    Integrating Selenium and Playwright tests into CI/CD workflows for continuous testing.

This repository will showcase automation projects and frameworks Iâ€™ve built using Python, Selenium, and Playwright, reflecting my commitment to delivering high-quality software through automation.
